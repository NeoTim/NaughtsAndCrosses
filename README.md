# NaughtsAndCrosses
Simple Naughts and Crosses (Tic Tac Toe) AI using a straight forward minimax algorithm in C++.  I built this on a long haul flight because my daughter asked me how a computer could play naughts and crosses.

Currently, the front-end is just text on the command console.  Human is always naughts and always goes first.  The keys:

1 2 3

q w e

a s d

Each correspond to a grid-cell on the game board.  Choose a cell and then hit enter to make a turn.
